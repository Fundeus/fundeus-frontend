        <p>
          The challenge of this project was to develop a machine learning
          algorithm in 14 weeks that will be used in cataract, glaucoma, and
          diabetic retinopathy diagnosis as a decision support system by an
          Ophthalmologist. The decision support system is an interactive website
          that enhances its ease of usage. Users are able to get detailed
          diagnostic reports by uploading a fundus image to the website, with
          the algorithmâ€™s accuracy rate. Also, using an additional
          patient-demographic form that asks sex, race and background
          informations we aimed to give further personalized information about
          the prediction.
